A repository intended to host some machine learning models for gas turbine health monitoring based on the datasets provided by NASA (1) (2) hosted here [article](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan).

This repository is inspired by Srinath Pereras and Roshan Alwis [article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/machine-learning-techniques-predictive-maintenance) on infoq about predictive maintenance for gas turbines.
